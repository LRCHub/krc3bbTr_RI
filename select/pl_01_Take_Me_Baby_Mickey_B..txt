Dancing
I wanna feel my beating
Get up ill show you the other
side
Jumping
What a beautiful night
Can't believe its you and I
Physical
Where were moving together along
that's you, the one
Chemical
When we are together, what's
going on?
This is the time
(Chorus)
Take me Baby! Light up the
spotlight
I wanna see what you show me
tonight
Take me baby! Counting this
heart of mine
I wanna stay till the night is
over
Take me Baby! Light up the
spotlight
I wanna see what you show me
tonight
Take me baby! Counting this
heart of mine
Now if wait till morn, come and
take me now
Show me
Where do you want me to lead

I got a dance that could move
your soul
Tell me
Now is the feeling alright?
I'll be your sun, you be mine
